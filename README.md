# Statistical-Computing-with-R
Statistics and Probability (STAT 400, ISU). Introduction to mathematical statistics that develops probability as needed


# Description
Introduction to mathematical statistics that develops probability as needed; includes the calculus of probability, random variables,
expectation, distribution functions, central limit theorem, point estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Offers a basic
one-term introduction to statistics and also prepares students for STAT 410 and STAT 425. Course Information: Same as MATH 463.

# Preliminaries
The website of The R Project for Statistical Computing is located at
http://www.r-project.org/
The software, along with necessary downloading and installation instructions, are provided on this website.
Among the extensive documentation contained on this site are answers to a list of frequently asked questions
(FAQ’s) which address issues that may arise in the downloading and installation of R onto your computer.

# The RGui and Console
Figure 1 is a snapshot of what is seen when R is first started up. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with
what is contained in the various drop-down menus contained in the RGui toolbar. In this course selected
options from only three menu items — File, Packages and Help — will be used. Other menu options can be
considered conveniences, the uses which you may learn at a later stage in your future adventures with R.
The R console provides a command line environment within which instructions for the R interpreter
can be entered. When a sequence of instructions is entered in the console, R interprets and executes the 
instructions.

Note that the startup screen contains some preliminary basic instructions. Before continuing, clear the
console by pressing the Ctrl key and then the l-key (denoted by Ctrl+L). This task can also be acomplished
through an option in the Edit menu on the toolbar.

# R’s Help Features
Information and help on R can be obtained using options present in the drop down menu, Help, on the RGui
toolbar, see Figure 3. The options provided are reasonably self-explanatory and can be extremely useful, so
time spent exploring the various resources available through the Help menu options is time well spent. Two
functions, help (can also use the shortcut “?”) and help.search (can also use the shortcut “??”) will be
found very useful. These can be run on the console. For example, run the following lines of code on the
console, one at a time (type in and press the enter key), and then browse through the documentation pages
that pop up.
